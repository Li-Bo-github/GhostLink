## Project Introduction 
The Anonymous Chatroom Application is designed for users who value privacy and anonymity. Unlike traditional chat platforms, our app lets users interact in interest-based groups using different identities across each group, ensuring privacy and freedom of expression. With encrypted message storage, the application guarantees that user conversations remain secure and confidential.

Whether you're looking to connect with like-minded individuals, share ideas freely, or simply explore new interests, this app creates a safe, anonymous space for open communication.
